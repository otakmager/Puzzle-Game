# Puzzle Game

I tried to recreate this application
from [this repository](https://github.com/memgonzales/sliding-puzzle) with a few changes such as
grouping files to improve readability, ease of maintenance, scalability and ease of collaboration.
Not only that, I also updated the library dependency and SDK platform and added a few modification
to some code and view but still retaining the main features which are almost 100% similar to
that [8-Puzzle sliding puzzle game](https://github.com/memgonzales/sliding-puzzle).
